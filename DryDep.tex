\begin{abstract}
 High concentrations of ozone in ambient air are hazardous not only to humans but to the ecosystem in general. The impact of ozone damage on vegetation and agricultural plants in combination with advancing climate change may affect food security in the future. While the future scenarios in themselves are uncertain, there are limiting factors constraining the accuracy of surface ozone modeling also at present: The distribution and amount of ozone precursor/depleting substances, the stratosphere-troposphere exchange as well as scavenging processes. Removal of any substance through gravitational settling or by uptake by plants and soil is referred to as dry deposition. The process of dry deposition is important for predicting surface ozone concentrations and understanding the observed amount and increase of tropospheric background ozone. The conceptual dry deposition velocities are calculated following a resistance-analogous approach wherein aerodynamic, quasi laminar, and canopy resistances are key components, but these are hard to measure explicitly. In this paper, we present an update of the dry deposition scheme implemented in the OsloCTM3. We change from an empirical dry deposition parameterization to a more process-based one which is taking the state of the atmosphere into account. Examining the sensitivity of the scheme to certain parameters, our focus lies mainly on the stomatal conductance-based description of the canopy resistance. We evaluate the resulting modeled ozone dry deposition with respect to observations and multi-model studies. We will also estimate the impact on the modeled ozone concentrations, both at the surface and in the free troposphere. We show that ozone dry deposition decreases with respect to the previous version, leading to an increase in surface ozone of up to ??\,\unit{\%}. {\bf TODO: Finish the results section as soon as there are results.}

\introduction  %% \introduction[modified heading if necessary]
Ozone is an important trace gas for all lifeforms on Earth. Depending on the place of its occurrence it has either a positive or negative connotation. In the stratosphere, ozone absorbs most of the ultraviolet (UV)-light from the sun within the range of 100--315\,\unit{nm}, thus shielding the Earth's surface from the most harmful UV-radiation. In addition, ozone is a potent greenhouse gas in both, stratosphere and troposphere. With a radiative forcing of $0.40 \pm 0.20\,\unit{W\,m^{-2}}$, it is placed third, only surpassed by \chem{CO_2} and \chem{CH_4} \citep[Chapter 8]{IPCC2013}.\\
In the troposphere and in particular in ambient air, ozone is considered as a highly toxic pollutant. Since the industrial revolution, tropospheric background ozone concentrations have been increasing in the northern hemisphere \citep[Chapter 2]{IPCC2013}. In recent years, the number of episodes of peak concentrations has been decreasing in North America and Europe due to the implementation of air quality regulations \citep[e.g.,][]{ACP:Wilson2012}. At the same time, fast developing countries, like e.g., China or India, saw a significant increase in ozone related air pollution. Continuously high concentrations of ambient air ozone are hazardous to the whole ecosystem. It is estimated that ozone is cause to an increase in pre-mature deaths \citep{WHO2008}, an average global loss of yield in the four major crops (wheat, rice, maize, and soybean) of about 3--15\,\unit{\%} \citep{PJ:Ainsworth2017} as well as 7\,\unit{\%} loss in primary production in forestry \citep{GCB:Wittig2009,EP:Matyssek2012}. The impact of ozone damage on vegetation and agricultural plants may affect food security in the future especially in Asia \citep{GCB:Tang2013,NCC:Tai2014,AE:Chuwah2015} and might be an important additional feedback to climate change \citep{Nat:Sitch2007}.\\
Tropospheric ozone is mainly produced in situ in complex photochemical cycles involving precursor gases such as carbon monoxide (\chem{CO}) or volatile organic substances (VOCs - also known as hydrocarbons) in the presents of nitrogen oxides (\chem{NO_x}). A typical reaction mechanism for \chem{CO} is sketched in the following. In a sequence of rapid reactions a peroxyl radical \chem{HO_2^\bullet} is formed through an initial reaction of \chem{CO} with a hydroxyl radical \chem{^\bullet OH}.
%\begin{reaction}
%  ^\bullet\chem{OH} + \chem{CO} \rightarrow {^\bullet\chem{HOCO}}\\
%  ^\bullet\chem{HOCO} + \chem{O_2} \rightarrow \chem{HO_2^\bullet} + \chem{CO_2}.
%\end{reaction}
Via a reaction between \chem{HO_2^\bullet} and \chem{NO}, \chem{NO_2} is formed which is then photolyzed. The resulting atomic oxygen reacts then with \chem{O_2} (and any other available co-reactant $M$) to form an ozone molecule.
%\begin{reaction}
%  \chem{HO_2^\bullet} + \chem{NO} \rightarrow {^\bullet\chem{OH}} + \chem{NO_2}\\
%  \chem{NO_2} + h\nu \rightarrow \chem{NO} + \chem{O(^3{P})}\\
%^\bullet\chem{O(^3P)} + \chem{O_2} + M \rightarrow \chem{O_3} + M.
%\end{reaction}
Such a cycle leads to a net production via:
\begin{reaction}
  \chem{CO} + 2\chem{O_2} + h\nu \rightarrow \chem{CO_2} + \chem{O_3}.
\end{reaction}
Similar cycles involving VOCs exist \citep{ACP:Monks2015}. Another source of tropospheric ozone is downward transport from the stratosphere via stratosphere-troposphere exchange (STE) \citep{WMO2014}. Based on observations, STE might only amount to roughly 10\,\unit{\%} ($550 \pm 140$\,\unit{Tg\,a^{-1}}) of the total global ozone budget in the troposphere, while ozone from chemical production is estimated to be 5000\,\unit{Tg\,a^{-1}} \citep{ACP:Monks2015}. Ozone is removed from the atmosphere by photochemical reactions or scavenging processes. Major sinks are photolysis followed by a reaction with water vapor to from \chem{OH},
%\begin{reaction}
%  \chem{O_3} + h\nu \rightarrow \chem{O(^1D)} + \chem{O_2})\\
%  \chem{O(^1D)} + \chem{H_2O} \rightarrow 2\chem{OH},

and dry deposition. We will come back to the latter later in this section and cover the implemented scheme in more detail in Section~\ref{subsec:DryDep}. A dry deposition related sink limited to Arctic regions are so called ozone depleting events. They occur in spring-time in the polar boundary layer where an outburst of bromine monoxide \chem{BrO} (so called bromine explosion) leads to a rapid depletion of surface ozone \citep{JGR:Oltmans1981,GRL:Bottenheim1986,Nat:Barrie1988,JGR:Bottenheim2006}. Various schemes ranging from bulk-snow parameterization \citep{ACP:Toyota2011,GMD:Falk2018} to detailed in-snow \citep{ACP:Toyota2014a}, and aerosol chemistry \citep{ACP:Yang2010} have been successfully applied to different types of atmospheric models but do not yet cover the full range of observed events. Although these ozone depleting events are important to understand surface ozone abundance in Arctic regions, we have not implemented any parameterization of these processes in the OsloCTM3 as of now. We also do not consider the contribution of very short-lived ozone depleting substances (VSLS), that affect stratospheric ozone \citep{JGR:Warwick2006, ACP:Ziska2013, ACP:Hossaini2016, ACP:Falk2017}, to the tropospheric ozone abundance.\\
Since ozone is highly reactive, its global mean life-time in the troposphere is roughly 22 days but ranges between a few days in the tropical boundary layer to up to one year in the upper troposphere \citep{JGR:Stevenson2005,ACP:Young2013}. The abundance of tropospheric ozone therefore varies, e.g., with time of the day (maximum $\sim$15:00 local time), season (mid-June maximum), altitude, location \citep{ACP:Schnell2015}, or weather conditions in general \citep{ACP:Otero2018}. Typical concentrations of surface ozone range from 10\,\unit{ppb} over the tropical Pacific to 100\,\unit{ppb} in the downwind areas of highly emitting sources \citep[Chapter 8]{IPCC2013}. This variability poses a challenge on both, trend analysis from observation as well as validation and intercomparison of models. At the observational side, there is only a limited number of long-term ozone observations, mainly restricted to European sites. Most of these indicate a doubling of tropospheric ozone since the 1950s \citep[Chapter 2]{IPCC2013}. But especially the very low pre-industrial ozone abundance cannot be reproduced by the likes of most models. Among the participating models in the Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate Model Intercomparison Project (ACCMIP), there is a general tendency to underestimate tropospheric ozone burden (e.g., $10-20$\,\unit{\%} negative bias at 250\,\unit{hPa} in the southern hemisphere (SH) tropical region) \citep[Chapter 8]{IPCC2013}. With respect to surface ozone, \citet{ACP:Schnell2015} conclude that all ACCMIP models, which reported hourly surface ozone, tend to overestimate surface ozone values in North America and Europe in comparison with available observations. A key to fathom these slightly contradicting results may lie in the used dry deposition schemes.\\
Removal of any substance through gravitational settling or by uptake by plants and soil is referred to as dry deposition. The process of dry deposition is important for predicting surface ozone concentrations and understanding the observed amount and increase of tropospheric background ozone. It is estimated that about $1000 \pm 200$\,\unit{Tg\,a^{-1}} of ozone are removed from the atmosphere by dry deposition processes \citep{ACP:Monks2015}. Conceptually, dry deposition is a product between surface ozone concentration \chem{[O_3](z_0)} and a dry deposition velocity $v^\chem{O_3}_d$. Dry deposition velocities $v^i_d$, which later on are synonymously referred to as conductance $G^i$, for any gaseous species $i$, are typically calculated following a resistance-analogous approach
\begin{equation}
  v^i_d = \frac{1}{R_a + R^i_b + R^i_c},
  \label{eq:drydep_velo}
\end{equation}
wherein aerodynamic $R_a$, quasi-laminar layer $R^i_b$, and canopy resistances $R^i_c$ are key components \citep{AE:Wesely1989,ACP:Seinfeld2006}. For all gases, $R_a$ is the same, while $R^i_b$ and $R^i_c$ vary from gas to gas and also depend on land surface types (e.g., ice/snow, water, urban, desert, agricultural land, deciduous forest, coniferous forest etc.). Originally, \citet{AE:Wesely1989} used fixed seasonal average dry deposition resistances for each land surface type. For all three types of resistances in this Wesely-type parameterization, more process-oriented formulations have been developed and validated over the years. \citet{ACP:Luhar2017} have validated ozone dry deposition to the ocean with respect to three different formulations of surface resistances. An update on the ozone surface resistance over snow and ice covered surfaces has been provided from combined model and observation studies \citep[][$v^\chem{O_3}_\text{ice/snow} = 1/10000\,\unit{cm\,s^{-1}}$]{ACP:Helmig2007}. Canopy conductance is parameterized at the single-leaf-level (stomatal conductance) for various plant function types (PFT) as well as single species based on empirical studies \citep{PTRS:Jarvis1976, BallBerry1987, ACP:Simpson2012, ICP:MappingManual2017}. But progress has also been made on process oriented modeling of stomatal conductance \citep{AFM:Anderson2000,PP:Buckley2017}. The variety of differing formulations and choices of parameters leads to a wide spread in model intercomparisons \citep{ACP:Hardacre2015,AE:Derwent2018} and about 20\,\unit{\%} uncertainty on the resulting total dry deposition \citep{ACP:Monks2015}.\\

In Section~\ref{sec:model_des}, we will briefly describe the OsloCTM3, give a detailed account of the new dry deposition scheme (Section~\ref{subsec:DryDep}) as well as present pre-processing of meteorological input data to compute necessary input to the dry deposition scheme such as begin and duration of greening season (GDAY, GLEN) and photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) (Section~\ref{subsec:pre-pro}). In Section~\ref{sec:eval}, we present sensitivity tests with respect to a manifold of parameters in the dry deposition scheme (Section~\ref{subsec:sens}) and validate our results with results from the multi-model intercomparison of \citet{ACP:Hardacre2015} (Section~\ref{subsec:model}) and to observations both at the surface as well as in the free troposphere (Section~\ref{subsec:obs}). In Section~\ref{sec:disc}, we will summarize our results and draw conclusions for further development of the model (Section~\ref{sec:conc}).

\section{Model description}
\label{sec:model_des}
The OsloCTM3 is a three dimensional global chemistry transport model (CTM). The key components of the OsloCTM3 have been described and evaluated by \citet{GMD:Sovde2012}. A detailed account of the capabilities of the OsloCTM3 in simulating anthropogenic aerosol forcing in the past and recent past using the Community Emission Data System (CEDS) historical emission inventory \citep{GMD:Hoesly2018} is given by \citet{GMD:Lund2018}. The OsloCTM3 can also be coupled to the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN v2.10) \citep{ACP:Guenther2006}. A publication focusing on this is planed. Parallelization of the OsloCTM3 has not been optimized as of now. While the meteorological data driving the OsloCTM3 is given in a resolution of at T159N80L60, it is very time and memory consuming to run the CTM with full chemistry at this resolution. Therefore, we run with a reduced horizontal resolution of $2.25^\circ\times2.25^\circ$. In the following, we will give a detailed account of the new dry deposition scheme. Although some of the equations in this section may be \emph{textbook knowledge}, for the sake of completeness, it is important to summarize them, nonetheless.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Ozone dry deposition scheme}
\label{subsec:DryDep}
In the original dry deposition scheme of the OsloCTM3, the state of the atmosphere was not taken into account. Dry deposition velocities were rather parameterized following the work of \citet{AE:Wesely1989} with parameter updates from \citet{JGR:Hough1991}. This means that seasonal day and night average deposition velocities for different land surface types (water, forest, grass, tundra/desert, and ice and snow) were in use. Day was distinguished from night by solar zenith angles below 90\,\unit{^\circ}. Winter was defined by temperatures below 273.15\,\unit{K} for gridboxes containing land masses. For ocean, winter and summer parameters are equal in this parameterization, therefore no distinctive treatment is needed for ocean gridboxes. In addition, a reduced uptake due to snow cover above 1\,\unit{m} for forest and 10\,\unit{cm} for grass/tundra, respectively, was taken into account. We will refer to this parameterization as \emph{Wesely scheme}.\\

Regarding the new dry deposition scheme, we follow the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP) MSC-W model \citep{WASP:Simpson2003,ACP:Simpson2012}, which is used for air quality modeling implementing the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP). We will refer to this as \emph{EMEP scheme} throughout the rest of the paper. The EMEP scheme is a more physical approach compared to the previously used Wesely scheme, because it takes state (e.g., pressure, temperature)  of the atmosphere as well as dynamics (e.g., wind stress) of the boundary layer into account. To a certain degree, the global variety of plants and their variability throughout the seasons is also acknowledged. The EMEP scheme is implemented for the gaseous species \chem{O_3}, \chem{H_2O_2}, \chem{NO_2}, \chem{PAN}, \chem{SO_2}, \chem{NH_3}, \chem{HCHO}, and \chem{CH_3CHO}. Since \chem{CO} has a very small uptake and is not included in \citet{WASP:Simpson2003,ACP:Simpson2012}, the Wesely parameterization is kept. In addition to the gaseous species, some of the aerosol deposition velocities are also modified, namely black carbon (BC) and organic carbon (OC), sulfuric aerosols (\chem{SO_4}, \chem{MSA}) and secondary organic aerosols (SOA). As displayed in Eq.~(\ref{eq:drydep_velo}), the dry deposition computation is typically split into three different resistance contributions (aerodynamic $R_a$, quasi-laminar layer $R^i_b$, and canopy $R^i_c$) which we will recap in the following.

\subsubsection{Aerodynamic resistance}
\label{subsubsec:Ra}
The aerodynamic resistance is describing the turbulent transport of any substance down to the surface. In \citet{WASP:Simpson2003,ACP:Simpson2012} it is described as
\begin{equation}
  R_a = \frac{1}{\kappa u_*}\left[{\ln{\left(\frac{z-d}{z_0}\right)}-\Psi_m\left(\frac{z-d}{z_0}\right)-\Psi_m\left(\frac{z_0}{L}\right)}\right],
\end{equation}
with $\kappa = 0.40$ the K\'{a}rm\'{a}n constant, $u_*$ the friction velocity, $\Psi_m$ the integrated stability equations for momentum, $d$ a constant (typically 0.7\,\unit{m}), and $L$ the Obukhov length. For certain values of $z$, $z_0$, and $L$, this may result in nonphysical (negative) values for $R_a$. For this reason, we diverge from the EMEP scheme at this point and fall back to the method of \citet{Monteith1973}, wherein the sensible heat flux $\Phi_{Q_\text{sensible}}$ is written as
\begin{equation}
  \Phi_{Q_\text{sensible}} = \rho_\text{air}\,c_P \cdot \frac{\partial_z T}{\partial_z R_a}.
  \label{eq:sens_heat}
\end{equation}
Herein, $\rho_\text{air}$ is the air density, $c_P$ the specific heat at constant pressure $P$, $\partial_z R_a$ is the diffusion resistance to sensible heat between surface ($z_0 = 0$) and the reference height $z$, and $\partial_z T$ is the difference between the surface temperature $T_0$ and the temperature at a reference height $T_z$. From the eddy diffusion theorem, a similar formulation can be derived
\begin{equation}
  \Phi_{Q_\text{sensible}} = \rho_\text{air}\,c_P \cdot \frac{\partial_z T}{\partial_z u} \cdot u_*^2.
  \label{eq:eddy_theo}
\end{equation}
Comparing Eq.~(\ref{eq:sens_heat}) and Eq.~(\ref{eq:eddy_theo}) and assuming $\partial_z R_a \rightarrow R_a $ and $\partial_z u \rightarrow u_z $ for a finite $z$, we find 
\begin{equation}
  R_a = \frac{u_z}{u_*^2}.
\end{equation}
As reference height $z$, we use the height at mid-level of the lowermost model level (roughly 8\,\unit{m}), while $u_z$ and $u_*$ are available from the meteorological input fields ($u_* = \sqrt{\frac{\tau_0}{\rho}}$, with the turbulent surface stress $\tau_0^2 = \text{NSSS}^2 + \text{EWSS}^2$, and Northward turbulent surface stress (NSSS), eastward turbulent surface stress (EWSS)).
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Quasi-laminar layer resistance}
\label{subsubsec:Rb}
The quasi-laminar layer resistance $R_b^i$ is species specific and differs over land and ocean surfaces. In case a gridbox contains both, a weighted mean is calculated.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection*{Land}
Over land, we use \citep[Eq.~(53),][]{ACP:Simpson2012}
\begin{equation}
  R_b^i = \frac{2}{\kappa u_*} \cdot \left(\frac{\text{Sc}_i}{\text{Pr}}\right)^{\frac{2}{3}},
  \label{eq:Rb}
\end{equation}
wherein $\text{Pr}$ is the Prandtl number (typically 0.72 for air and other gases) and $\text{Sc}_i$ is the Schmidt number for a gas $i$. Eq.~(\ref{eq:Rb}) differs from a similar formulation in \citet{ACP:Seinfeld2006} by a factor of roughly $1.25$. From $\text{Sc}_i = \nu/D_i$, with the kinematic viscosity of air $\nu$, we derive a Schmidt number in water equivalent:
\begin{equation}
  \text{Sc}_i = \frac{D_\chem{H_2O}}{D_i} \cdot \text{Sc}_\chem{H_2O},
\end{equation}
with the molecular diffusivity for any gas $D_i$, the Schmidt number of water ($\text{Sc}_\chem{H_2O}=0.6$) and a its molecular diffusivity ($D_\chem{H_2O}=0.21\cdot10^{-4}\,\unit{m^2\,s^{-1}}$). The used ratios $D_\chem{H_2O}/D_i$ are displayed in Table~\ref{tab:diffusivity}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection*{Ocean}
Over ocean, we use \citep[Eq.~(54),][]{ACP:Simpson2012}
\begin{equation}
  R_b^i = \frac{1}{\kappa u_*}\cdot\ln\left({\frac{z_0}{D_i}\cdot \kappa u_*}\right)
\end{equation}
with an imposed lower threshold of 10\,\unit{s\,m^{-1}} and an upper limit of 1000\,\unit{s\,m^{-1}}. The computation of roughness length $z_0$ over ocean is divided into a \emph{calm} and a \emph{rough} sea case, where wind speeds above 3\,\unit{m\,s^{-1}} are considered as boundary between both cases. For calm sea, we apply the following upper limit \citep[][with a slightly higher coefficient of $0.135$]{Hinze1975,Garratt1992}
\begin{equation}
  z_0^\text{calm} = \text{min}\left\{2\cdot10^{-3}, 0.135 \cdot \frac{\nu}{u_*}\right\}.
\end{equation}
The kinematic viscosity of air $\nu$ herein can be computed from 
\begin{equation}
  \nu = \frac{\mu}{\rho} = \frac{\mu(T)}{\frac{P_0}{T\cdot R_\text{air}}}.
  \label{eq:kinematic_viscosity}
\end{equation}
For the temperature dependent dynamic viscosity of air $\mu(T)$, we chose a linear fit to Sutherland's law through the origin within the temperature range $\{T \in \mathbb{R} | (243.15 < T < 313.15)\,\unit{K}\}$: $\mu(T) = 6.2\cdot 10^{-8}\,\unit{kg\,m^{-1}\,s^{-1}\,K^{-1}} \cdot T$. But despite its rough accuracy, we found that the choice of $\mu(T)$ has no effect on $\left<R_b\right>$ (Supplement S.1). In Eq.~(\ref{eq:kinematic_viscosity}), $\rho$ is substituted by the air density using the ideal gas law. $P_0$ is the surface pressure, as $T$ the 2\,\unit{m} temperature is chosen, and $R_\text{air}$ is the universal gas constant for air.
The rough sea case follows the method of \citet{QJRMS:Charnock1955,JPO:Wu1980}:
\begin{equation}
  z_0^\text{rough} = \text{min}\left\{2\cdot10^{-3}, 0.018 \cdot \frac{u^2_*}{g}\right\}
\end{equation}
with a gravitational acceleration $g = 9.836\,\unit{m\,s^{-2}}$. The allowed maximum roughness length in both cases is set to 2\,\unit{mm}. Since the $z_0$ computed with this parameterization are rather small ($0 < z_0^\text{calm} < 1\cdot 10^{-4}\,\unit{m}$, $0 < z_0^\text{rough} < 2 \cdot 10^{-3}\,\unit{m}$), $R^i_b$ is set to its lower limit of 10\,\unit{s\,m^{-1}} in about 91\,\unit{\%} of all cases (see Supplement S.1). 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Surface resistance}
\label{subsubsec:Rc}
The surface resistance consists of both, stomatal and non-stomatal resistances. When computing gridbox averages, we use the sum of conductances (deposition velocities)
\begin{equation}
  G_c = \text{LAI} \cdot G_\text{sto} + G_\text{ns}, 
\end{equation}
wherein $\text{LAI}$ is the leaf area index (zero for non-vegetated surfaces), $G_\text{sto}$ the stomatal conductance, and $G_\text{ns}$ the non-stomatal conductance.

The stomatal conductance is a measure of the rate of \chem{CO_2} evapotranspiration through the stomata of a leaf. There are several environmental conditions affecting the opening and closing of the stomata and hence their capability of respiration (e.g., light, available water, etc.). Stomata sluggishness, a state in which the stomata can no longer fully close, has been reported as ozone induced damage \citep{SR:Hoshika2015}. To reflect part of the underlying mechanism, the stomatal conductance $g_\text{STO}$ in the EMAP scheme is computed using a multiplicative ansatz that is also explained in much detail in \citet{ICP:MappingManual2017}:
%
\begin{equation}
  g_\text{STO} = g^\text{m}_\text{max} \cdot f_\text{phen} \cdot f_\text{light} \cdot \max{\left\{f_\text{min}, f_T \cdot f_D \cdot f_\text{SW}\right\}}.
  \label{eq:stomatal}
\end{equation}
%
The factors herein are normalized and vary within the range $0-1$. They account for leaf phenology ($f_\text{phen}$), light ($f_\text{light}$), temperature ($f_T$), water vapor pressure deficit ($f_D$), and soil water content ($f_\text{SW}$).

The temperature adjustment $f_T$ of plants is computed from
%
\begin{equation}
  f_T = \frac{T_\text{2m}-T_\text{min}}{T_\text{opt}-T_\text{min}} \cdot \left(\frac{T_{\text{max}}-T_\text{2m}}{T_{\text{max}}-T_\text{opt}}\right)^\beta, 
\end{equation}
with $\beta = \frac{T_\text{max}-T_\text{opt}}{T_\text{opt}-T_\text{min}}$. The parameters $T_\text{min}$, $T_\text{max}$ and $T_\text{opt}$ are tabulated for various land surface types. All parameters used in the EMEP scheme can be found in the supplementary to \citet{ACP:Simpson2012} or in Supplement~S.2. Since $f_T$ becomes negative outside its range defined by $T_\text{min}$, $T_\text{max}$, we impose a lower limit of $0.01$.

The water vapor deficit (VPD) is proportional to the saturation partial pressure of water ($P_\chem{H_2O}^s$) and relative humidity ($\text{RH}$)
%
\begin{equation}
  \text{VPD} = P_\chem{H_2O}^s \cdot (1 - \text{RH}/100).
\end{equation}
%
Using tabulated values of $f_\text{min}$, $D_\text{min}$, $D_\text{max}$, the water vapor pressure deficit penalty factor $f_D$ can be computed:
%
\begin{equation}
  f_D = f_\text{min}+(1-f_\text{min}) \cdot \frac{D_\text{min} - \text{VPD}}{D_\text{min}-D_\text{max}}.
\end{equation}

The penalty factor with respect to available soil water ($\text{SW}$) $f_\text{SW}$ is defined as 
%
\begin{equation}
  f_\text{SW} =
  \begin{cases}
    1 & \quad \emph{if} \quad \text{SW} \geq 0.5,\\
    2 \cdot \text{SW}  & \quad \emph{if} \quad \text{SW} < 0.5.
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
\citet{ACP:Simpson2012} suggest using SW in soil depths below 1\,\unit{m} (SWVL4 in OpenIFS). Throughout most of our simulations (Section~\ref{sec:eval}), we have, however, used the soil water contained in the top layer (SWVL1, $0-7\,\unit{cm}$), which makes the canopy conductance more sensitive to precipitation than it would be otherwise.

The phenology of a plant typically describes its lifecycle through out a year, e.g., in mid latitudes and for deciduous species, it starts with the emergence of leafs in spring and ends in fall. In the EMEP scheme, phenology is parameterized with respect to the start of the greening season (SGS) and its end (EGS). Details about our treatment of these are given in Section~\ref{subsubsec:greening}. In summary, our adaption of the $f_\text{phen}$ parameterization reads as follows:
%
\begin{equation}
  f_\text{phen} =
  \begin{cases}
    \emph{if} \quad \text{GDAY = 0}  & \quad 0 \\
    \emph{if} \quad \text{GLEN $\ge$ 365} & \quad 1 \quad \emph{(explicitly excluding Tropics)} \\
    \emph{else}  & \quad 
    \begin{cases}
      \emph{if} \quad \text{GDAY} \le \phi_\text{AS}  & \quad \phi_a \\
      \emph{if} \quad \text{GDAY} \le \phi_\text{AS} + \phi_e  & \quad \phi_b+(\phi_c-\phi_b)\cdot(\text{GDAY}-\phi_\text{AS})/\phi_e\\
      \emph{if} \quad \text{GDAY} \le \text{GLEN} - \phi_\text{AE} - \phi_f  & \quad \phi_c\\
      \emph{if} \quad \text{GDAY} \le \text{GLEN} - \phi_\text{AE}  & \quad \phi_d+(\phi_c-\phi_d)\cdot(\text{GLEN}-\phi_\text{AE}-\text{GDAY})/\phi_f\\
      \emph{else} & \quad \phi_d
    \end{cases}
  \end{cases}
  \label{eq:fphen}
\end{equation}
%
Herein, we use the SGS and EGS derived parameters day of greening season (GDAY), the time elapsed starting at the SGS, and the total length of the greening season (GLEN), the time span between EGS and SGS. The parameters $\phi_a$, $\phi_b$, $\phi_c$, and $\phi_d$ define start or end points in the five phases of phenology in the EMEP scheme, while $\phi_e$, $\phi_f$, $\phi_\text{AS}$, and $\phi_\text{AE}$ control the temporal timing (Fig.~\ref{fig:phenology}). If GLEN is zero we are most likely in Arctic regions and there is no vegetation anyway, therefore $f_\text{phen}=0$. Before the start of the growing season ($\text{GDAY}=0$) $f_\text{phen}=0$. Since the EMEP scheme is tuned to northern hemisphere (NH) mid latitudes, this phenology does not apply to the tropics, after evaluation of the model results (Section~\ref{subsec:sens}), we decided to set $f_\text{phen}=1$ if GLEN is greater or equal to 365 which is the case in the tropics.

\end{figure}

Light in the wavelength band $(400-700)$\,\unit{nm} to which the plant chlorophyll is sensitive is called photosynthetic active radiation (PAR). The integral of PAR over these wavelengths is the photosynthetic photon flux denisty (PPFD). In the EMEP parameterization, this integrated photon flux is used to mimic the time lag of the opening and closing of stomata with respect to light instead of a simple day-on/night-off treatment:
\begin{equation}
  f_\text{light} = 1-\text{exp}(-\alpha_\text{light}\cdot \text{PPFD}).
  \label{eq:flight}
\end{equation}

Since $g_\text{max}$ in Eq.~(\ref{eq:stomatal}) is in units of \unit{mmol\,s^{-1}\,m^{-2}}, a unit conversion is done:
\begin{equation}
  g^\text{m}_{\text{sto}}(N) = g_{\text{sto}}(N) \cdot R \cdot \frac{T_0}{P_0}.
\end{equation}
Herein, $R$ is the universal gas constant. With these, the total gridbox stomatal conductance $G_\text{sto}$ is computed weighted by the land surface type fraction $f_L(N)$:
\begin{equation}
  G_\text{sto} = \sum_{N=0}^{N_\text{max}} f_L(N)\cdot g^\text{m}_{\text{sto}}(N)
\end{equation}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection*{Non-stomatal conductance}
In the EMEP scheme, non-stomatal conductances are explicitly calculated for \chem{O_3}, \chem{SO_2}, \chem{HNO_3}, and \chem{NH_3}. For all other species, an interpolation between \chem{O_3} and \chem{SO_2} values is carried out.

The non-stomatal conductance for \chem{O_3} consists of two terms, one depending on vegetation type and one depending on the soil/surface. For a land surface type $N$, we can write
\begin{equation}
  G_\text{ns}^\chem{O_3}(N) = \frac{\text{SAI}(N)}{r_\text{ext}} + \frac{1}{R_\text{inc}(N) + R_\text{gs}^\chem{O_3}(N)}.
  \label{eq:non-stomata-cond}
\end{equation}
$\text{SAI}(N)$ is the surface area index for vegetation type $N$, which is $\text{LAI}$ plus some value representing cuticles and others surfaces. The external leaf resistance is defined by
\begin{equation}
  r_\text{ext} = 2000\,\unit{s\,m^{-1}}\cdot F_T.
\end{equation}
Herein $F_T$ is a temperature correction factor for temperatures below $-1\,\unit{^\circ C}$ and $\{F_T \in \mathbb{R} | (1 \leq F_T \leq 2)\}$
\begin{equation}
  F_T = \exp{(-2\cdot(1+\theta_0))}.
\end{equation}
$\theta_0$ is the surface or 2\,\unit{m} temperature in \unit{^\circ C}. In general, $\text{SAI} \equiv \text{LAI}$ for all land types, except for: 
%
\begin{equation}
  \text{SAI} = 
  \begin{cases}
    \text{LAI}+1 & \emph{if} \quad \text{\emph{forest / wetland}},\\
    \text{LAI}\cdot 5/3.5 & \emph{if} \quad \text{\emph{cropland}, I. part of growing season},\\
    \text{LAI} + 1.5 & \emph{if} \quad \text{\emph{cropland}, II. part of growing season},\\
    0 & \emph{if} \quad \text{\emph{cropland}, winter}.
  \end{cases}
  \label{eq:SAI}
\end{equation}
%
Extending the EMEP scheme to the southern hemisphere, the used growing season for crops is defined in Table~\ref{tab:growing_season}.
%
\begin{table}[t]
  \caption{Definition of growing season for crops used in the OsloCTM3 in northern hemisphere (NH) and southern hemisphere (SH).}
  \begin{tabular}{lrr}
    \tophline
    & I. part & II. part \\
    & (days) & (days) \\
    \middlehline

    \bottomhline
  \end{tabular}
  %\belowtable{} % Table Footnotes
  \label{tab:growing_season}
\end{table}
%

In this way, vegetation affects the conductance also by being there, not only by uptake through the stomata. The in-canopy resistance $R_\text{inc}$ is defined for each vegetated land type $N$ as
\begin{equation}
  R_\text{inc} = b \cdot \text{SAI}(N) \cdot \frac{h(N, \text{lat})}{u_*},
\end{equation}
where $h(N, \text{lat})$ is the latitude dependent vegetation height (see explanation at the end of this section) and $b = 14\,\unit{s^{-1}}$ is an empirical constant. According to \citet{ACP:Simpson2012}, the canopy resistance in EMEP does not take temperature and snow into account and is zero for non-vegetated surfaces.\\
$R_\text{gs}^\chem{O_3}(N)$ is tabulated and corrected for temperature by $F_T$ and snow cover fraction $f_\text{snow}$:
\begin{equation}
  \frac{1}{R_\text{gs}^\chem{O_3}(N)} = \frac{1-f_\text{snow}}{\hat{R}_\text{gs}^\chem{O_3}(N)} + \frac{f_\text{snow}}{R_\text{snow}^\chem{O_3}}.
\end{equation}
As initially mentioned, the necessary depth of snow to cover a certain type of vegetation, differs. Therefore, we calculate a snow cover fraction $f_\text{snow}$ using the snow depth $S_D$, which is available in units of meter of water equivalent from the meteorological input data, scaled to 10\,\unit{\%} of the vegetation height.

The total conductance $G_\text{ns}^\chem{O_3}$ in each gridbox is the sum of all $G_\text{ns}^\chem{O_3}(N)$ weighted by the land surface type fraction $f_L(N)$
\begin{equation}
  G_\text{ns}^\chem{O_3} = \sum_{N=0}^{N_\text{max}}{G_\text{ns}^\chem{O_3}(N) \cdot f_L(N)}.
\end{equation}

\subsubsection*{Latitude dependent vegetation height}
The vegetation height $h(N, \text{lat})$ in the EMEP scheme is linearly decreasing with latitude between 60 and 74\,\unit{^\circ north}. To adapt this to a global model, we need to make a few additional assumptions. The tabulated height for each vegetation type $h(N)$ in the EMEP scheme is regarded as constant at mid latitudes (40--60\,\unit{^\circ}). Towards the poles, we decrease the height of each vegetation type using the same rate as described in \citet{ACP:Simpson2012}. At a latitude of 74\,\unit{^\circ} a minimum height of $3/10 \cdot h(N)$ is reached and kept constant. Towards the equator, we increase the height linearly so that at a latitude of 10\,\unit{^\circ} a maximum height of $2 \cdot h(N)$ is achieved which is then held constant. We also assume symmetry in both hemispheres. Presuming a typical tree height of 20\,\unit{m} at mid latitudes, this step-wise function yields a height of 8\,\unit{m} at high latitudes and 40\,\unit{m} in the tropics which is not unrealistic. For four example PFTs, results are shown in the Supplement (Fig.~S.2). 

\subsubsection*{Mapping of land surface types}
Land surface types from, e.g., \href{https://daac.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/dataset_lister.pl?p=29}{ISLSCP2} product from MODIS or Community Land Model (\href{http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/tss/clm/}{CLM}) 2 categories, have to be mapped to the nine land surface types used in the EMEP scheme (Fig.~\ref{fig:pft_mapping}). For both, MODIS and CLM2 land surface categories, snow and ice cover is estimated from input meteorology, while water is defined as $1-\sum_{N=0}^{N_\text{max}} f_L(N)$. From the MODIS category \emph{Barren or sparsely vegetated}, everything polward from 60\,\unit{^\circ} is defined as tundra, while everything equatorward is categorized as desert.

\subsection{Dry deposition scheme for other gases and aerosols}
For \chem{NH_3}, \chem{SO_2}, and \chem{HNO_3}, we follow exactly the treatment as described by \citet{ACP:Simpson2012}. Since the dry deposition velocity for \chem{CO} is very small, we use a fixed value for $v_d^\chem{CO}$ of 0.03\,\unit{cm\,s^{-1}}.

The EMEP scheme for aerosols (BC, OC, \chem{SO_4}, \chem{MSA}, SOA) defines the surface deposition velocity $V_\text{ds}$ as
\begin{equation}
  \frac{V_\text{ds}}{u_*} =
  \begin{cases}
    a_1 &  \emph{if} \quad L \ge 0\,\unit{m}, \\
    a_1 \cdot F_N \left[ 1 + \left(\frac{a_2}{25}\right)^{2/3}\right] & \emph{if} \quad -25\,\unit{m} < L < 0\,\unit{m}, \\
    a_1 \cdot F_N \left[ 1 + \left(\frac{-a_2}{L}\right)^{2/3}\right] & \emph{if} \quad L \le -25\,\unit{m}, \\
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
wherein $F_N = 3$ for fine nitrate and ammonium and $F_N = 1$ for all other species. $L$ is again the Obukhov length. $a_2 = 300\,\unit{m}$, while $a_1$ differs for forest and non-forest. To account for hydrophilic and hydrophobic BC/OC aerosols on dry and wet surfaces, we diverge slightly from the EMAP scheme in the definition of the parameter $a_1$. From pre-studies with an aerosol microphysic model, we find
\begin{equation}
  a_1^\text{hydrophob.} = 0.025\,\unit{cm\,s^{-1}} \cdot \overline{u_*}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation} 
  a_1^\text{hydrophil.} = 0.2\,\unit{cm\,s^{-1}} \cdot \overline{u_*},
\end{equation}
with the annual mean friction velocity $\overline{u_*}$. Our definition of $a_1$ is then:
\begin{equation}
  a_1 =
  \begin{cases}
    \emph{if} \quad \emph{land} &
    \begin{cases}
      \emph{if} \quad \emph{non-forest} &  a_1^\text{hydrophob.}\\
      \emph{if} \quad \emph{forest} &
      \begin{cases}
        \emph{if} \quad \emph{dry} & \max{\left\{a_1^\text{hydrophob.}, 0.008\cdot\frac{\text{SAI}}{10}\right\}}\\
        \emph{if} \quad \emph{wet} & 1.5\cdot\max{\left\{a_1^\text{hydrophob.}, 0.008\cdot\frac{\text{SAI}}{10}\right\}}\\
    \end{cases}\\
    \end{cases}\\
    \emph{if} \quad \emph{ocean} &
    \begin{cases}
      a_1^\text{hydrophil.}\\
      a_1^\text{hydrophob.}\\
    \end{cases}\\
    \emph{if} \quad \emph{ice} &
    \begin{cases}
      \emph{if} \quad \theta \le 0\,\unit{^\circ C} & a_1^\text{hydrophob.}\\
      \emph{if} \quad \theta > 0\,\unit{^\circ C} &
      \begin{cases}
        a_1^\text{hydrophil.}\\
        a_1^\text{hydrophob.}\\
      \end{cases}\\
    \end{cases}\\
  \end{cases}
  \label{eq:dd_aerosol_a1}
\end{equation}
%
The total aerosol surface deposition is then
\begin{equation}
 V_\text{ds}^\text{tot} = \sum_{N=0}^{N_\text{max}} V_\text{ds}(N) \cdot f_L(N).
\end{equation}

\subsection{Pre-processing}
\label{subsec:pre-pro}
As mentioned in the previous section, there are two variables needed for computing the stomatal conductance which are not directly available from the meteorological input data. The greening season, as the time of the year in the mid and high latitudes when it is most likely for plants to grow, and the photosynthetic photon flux density, as the amount of light plants need to photosynthesize. In the following, we present the necessary pre-processing of the variables.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Greening season}
\label{subsubsec:greening}
In Eqs.~(\ref{eq:non-stomata-cond}--\ref{eq:SAI}), \citet{ACP:Simpson2012} use fixed start of growing season (SGS) and end of growing season (EGS) at $50\,\unit{^\circ N}$ ($d_\text{SGS}$, $d_\text{EGS}$) together with leaprates ($\nabla d_\text{SGS}$, and $\nabla d_\text{EGS}$) to define phenology and dry deposition over agricultural areas. For the growing season of crops in the computation of non-stomatal conductances, we use fixed values (Table~\ref{tab:growing_season}), while for the stomatal conductances, as shown in Eq.~(\ref{eq:fphen}), we use the SGS and EGS derived parameters: day of greening season (GDAY), the time elapsed starting at the SGS, and the total length of the greening season (GLEN), the time span between EGS and SGS. Since the eurocentric EMEP parameterization of SGS and EGS is not applicable in a global model, another latitude dependent parameterization is needed. First, we have used a parameterization as implemented in the Sparse Matrix Operational Kernel Emissions -- Biogenic Emission Inventory System (SMOKE-BEIS; \href{https://www.epa.gov/air-emissions-modeling/biogenic-emission-inventory-system-beis}{model webpage}). SMOKE-BEIS has fixed values for SGS and EGS for all regions but NH mid latitudes ($23\,\unit{^\circ} < \text{lat} < 65\,\unit{^\circ}$), where it uses leaprates of $\nabla d_\text{SGS} = 4.5$ and $\nabla d_\text{EGS} = 3.3$. As this parameterization is optimized for North America, it does not work well in Europe, e.g., most of northern Scandinavia has no allocated vegetation period. 

In agriculture, there are different empirical rules to estimate the SGS and EGS. The simplest assumption is that greening starts after 5 consecutive days with a daily average temperature above 5\,\unit{^\circ C} and vice versa for EGS. Based on this rule of thumb, we have pre-processed our meteorological input data offline. If, within these 5 days, the average temperature drops below / rises above 5\,\unit{^\circ C}, the counters are reset, respectively. First, we used the 5\,\unit{^\circ C}-days criteria for $45\,\unit{^\circ} < \text{lat} < 85\,\unit{^\circ}$ in the NH, but extended it also to $35\,\unit{^\circ} < \text{lat} < 65\,\unit{^\circ}$ in the SH. In all other cases and where the 5\,\unit{^\circ C}-days criteria fails, we use the SMOKE-BEIS parameterization. The described algorithm written in python 2.7 has been included as Supplement~S.4.1. An example map of the computed GLEN using the 5\,\unit{^\circ C}-days criteria in both hemispheres is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:glen_2015_she}.

  \label{fig:glen_2015_she}
\end{figure}
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Photosynthetic photon flux density}
From OpenIFS an accumulated PAR is available, but for practical use in Eq.~(\ref{eq:flight}) it needs to be deaccumulated. Since this field is already integrated assumingly over the spectrum $(400-700)\,\unit{nm}$, it is not PAR but PPFD. Therefor, we will refer to the deaccumulated field as PPFD. An example PAR for January 2nd 2005 is shown in Supplement~S.5.1. Deaccumulation of hour 3 till 21, simply means
\begin{equation}
  \text{PPFD}(t_i) = \text{PAR}(t_{i+1})-\text{PAR}(t_i).
\end{equation}
If everything was right in the OpenIFS output, we would not need to do any further processing, however the first timestep of each day has already accumulated PAR from some other date and time in addition to the actual hour 0 data (see Supplement~S.5.2), so it is impossible to accurately deaccumulate this time step. The best choice is subtracting the difference between hour 21 and 12 of the previous day (Supplement~S.5.3)
%
\begin{equation}
  \text{PPFD}(t=0) = \text{PAR}(t=0) - \left[\text{PAR}(t=21\,\unit{h}-1\,\unit{day})-\text{PAR}(=12\,\unit{h}-1\,\unit{day})\right].
\end{equation}
%
The resulting PPFD fields are still accumulated over a time period of three hours and should be devided by 3. A \href{https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA-Interim\%3A+surface+photosynthetically+active+radiation+\%28surface+PAR\%29+values+are+too+low}{known issue} in the OpenIFS (cycles $\le$ c41r2) causes surface PAR values to be about 30\,\unit{\%} below observations. To counter this, we decided to refrain from the devision at this stage.

\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:eval}
In this section, we present results from a manifold of OsloCTM3 model runs testing different parameters of the EMEP scheme. We focus on the changes in ozone, e.g., total dry deposition, dry deposition velocities, and surface concentration, related to the stomatal conductance parameterization. We evaluate our results with respect to \citet{ACP:Hardacre2015} (Section~\ref{subsec:model}) and observations (Section~\ref{subsec:obs}). The OsloCTM3 is driven by meteorological input fields from \href{https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/documentation-and-support/evolution-ifs/cycle-38r1-summary-changes}{ECMWF -- OpenIFS version cy38r1nc4}. CEDS historical emission inventory is used for anthropogenic emissions, while biomass burning is covered by NASA's Global Fire Emissions Database, Version4 (GFEDv4). In the following, we will discuss the various model sensitivity studies.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Sensitivity studies}
\label{subsec:sens}
As presented in Section~\ref{sec:model_des}, the OsloCTM3 dry deposition scheme hase been revised majorly. Due to the previously generalized implementation of the Wesely scheme with respect to dry deposition resistances and surface types, it is not possible to fully disentangle the effects of the changes. We have conducted 9 different model simulations to assess the parameter space of the EMEP scheme. A reference simulation featuring the Wesely scheme has been done and will be refered to as \emph{Wesely type}, indicating that other implementations of the original work by \citet{AE:Wesely1989} may exist in other models. For all model integrations, the meteorological reference year is 2005. This choice only affects the comparison with data and multi-model studies that either perform analysis on decadal averages or differing years. After finishing the work on the integration of the EMEP parameterization and initial testing, \emph{EMEP\_full} was supposed to be the baseline simulation for our sensitivity studies, \emph{EMEP\_offLight} and \emph{EMEP\_offPhen}. As indicated by the names, these scenarios are extreme cases, setting $f_\text{light}$ and $f_\text{phen}$ to 1, respectively. During analysis of the results, we found, that the SMOKE-BEIS parameterization of the greening season did not extend to the boreal and subarctic regions. Especially in Europe, basically resulting in the subpression of canopy resistance in these regions. The following sensitivity study therefor comprises two different versions of pre-processed greening season (refer to Section~\ref{subsec:pre-pro}), mid and high latitudes in the borthern hemisphere only (\emph{EMEP\_ppgs}) and for both, northern and southern hemisphere (\emph{EMEP\_ppgssh}). Building on the latter, we want to confirm the importance of the $v^\chem{O_3}_\text{ice/snow}$ update \citep{ACP:Helmig2007} in the Subarctic and Arctics, within the framework of the OsloCTM3. 

focussion on the details of the canopy resistance parameterization. 
 For simplicity, we only list the tested parameters. An x in the table denotes that the model was run exactly in the configuration as has been decribed in Section~\ref{sec:model_des}. With respect to the sensitivity on light (PPFD), $f_\text{light}\equiv 1$ has been tested. Regarding the phenology, we have tested three different options: No phenology ($f_\text{phen}\equiv 1$), phenology including / excluding the Tropics (TR). Diverging from \citet{ACP:Simpson2012}, the simulations inititally ran with the uppermost soil water level (SWVL1). One sensitivity test was conducted using SWVL4. The meteorological year used in all simulations is 2005. Most of the simulations were run with CEDS emissions for 2014. One test has been conducted to look at the impact of the emissions.
