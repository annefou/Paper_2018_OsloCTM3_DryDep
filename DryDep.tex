\begin{abstract}
  Since the industrial revolution, tropospheric background ozone concentrations have been increasing strongly mainly in the northern hemisphere. In recent years, the number of episodes of peak concentrations especially in summertime has been decreasing in North America and Europe due to the implementation of air quality regulations. At the same time, fast developing countries, like e.g., China or India, saw a significant increase in ozone related air pollution. High concentrations of ozone in ambient air are hazardous not only to humans but to the ecosystem in general. The impact of ozone damage on vegetation and agricultural plants in particular may even affect food security in the future. Most chemistry-transport models (CTMs) and chemistry-climate models (CCMs) tend to overestimate surface ozone values. This may be partly due to uncertainties in the distribution and amount of precursor species and stratosphere-troposphere exchange as well as scavenging processes removing ozone from the atmosphere. Removal of any gas through gravitational settling or by uptake by plants and soil is referred to as dry deposition. The process of dry deposition is important for predicting surface ozone concentrations and understanding the observed amount and increase of tropospheric background ozone. Dry deposition velocities are typically calculated following a resistance-analogous approach wherein aerodynamic, quasi laminar, and canopy resistances are key components, but these conceptual dry deposition velocities are hard to measure explicitly. Following the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP) MSC-W chemistry transport model, we compute canopy resistance from stomatal conductance. In this paper, we present an update on the dry deposition scheme implemented in the OsloCTM3v1.0 and evaluate the model with respect to ozone and different parameters in the stomatal conductance parameterization, e.g., photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) and phenology. Furthermore, we investigate the impact on modeled ozone concentrations, both at the surface and in the free troposphere. We show that ozone dry deposition in the new version (v.1.1) decreases with respect to the previous version (v1.0), leading to an increase in surface ozone of up to 40\,\unit{\%}. We also put our results in context to recent multi-model studies as well as satellite data.

\introduction  %% \introduction[modified heading if necessary]
Ozone is an important trace gas for all lifeforms on Earth. Depending on the place of its occurrence it has either a positive or negative connotation. In the stratosphere, ozone absorbs most of the ultraviolet (UV)-light from the sun in the range of 100--315\,\unit{nm}, thus shielding the Earth's surface from the most harmful UV-radiation. In addition, ozone is a potent greenhouse gas in both, stratosphere and troposphere. With a radiative forcing of $0.40 \pm 0.20\,\unit{Wm^{-2}}$, it is placed third, only surpassed by \chem{CO_2} and \chem{CH_4} \citep[Chapter 8]{IPCC2013}. In the troposphere and in particular in ambient air, ozone is considered as a highly toxic pollutant. Continuously high concentrations of ambient air ozone are hazardous to the whole ecosystem. It is estimated that ozone is cause to an increase in pre-mature deaths \citep{WHO2008}, an average global loss of yield in the four major crops (wheat, rice, maize, and soybean) of about 3--15\,\unit{\%} \citep{PJ:Ainsworth2017} as well as 7\,\unit{\%} loss in primary production in forestry \citep{GCB:Wittig2009,EP:Matyssek2012}. The impact of ozone damage on vegetation and agricultural plants in particular may even affect food security in the future especially in Asia \citep{GCB:Tang2013,NCC:Tai2014,AE:Chuwah2015} and might be an important additional feedback to climate change \citep{Nat:Sitch2007}. Since ozone is highly reactive, its global mean life-time in the troposphere is roughly 22 days \citep{JGR:Stevenson2005,ACP:Young2013}. It is mainly produced photochemically in situ from precursor gases such as hydrocarbons (e.g., \chem{CH_4}) in the presents of nitrogen oxides (\chem{NO_x}), carbon monoxide (\chem{CO}):
\begin{reaction}
  ^\bullet\chem{OH} + \chem{CO} \rightarrow {^\bullet\chem{HOCO}}\\
  ^\bullet\chem{HOCO} + \chem{O_2} \rightarrow \chem{H_2O} + \chem{CO_2}
 \end{reaction}
\begin{reaction}
  ^\bullet\chem{HO_2} + \chem{NO} \rightarrow {^\bullet\chem{OH}} + \chem{NO_2}\\
  \chem{NO_2} + h\nu \rightarrow \chem{NO} + \chem{O(^3{P})}\\
  ^\bullet\chem{O(^3P)} + \chem{O_2} \rightarrow \chem{O_3}
\end{reaction}
This leads to a net production via:
\begin{reaction}
  \chem{CO} + 2\chem{O_2} + h\nu \rightarrow \chem{CO_2} + \chem{O_3}
\end{reaction}
A part from these, additional reaction pathways involving volatile organic compounds (VOCs) exist. Another possible source of tropospheric ozone transportation down from the stratosphere via stratosphere-troposphere exchange (STE) \citep{WMO2014}. Major sinks are photolytical destruction, de-nitration via
\begin{reaction}
  \chem{NO} + \chem{O_3} \rightarrow \chem{NO_2} + \chem{O_2}
\end{reaction}
and
\begin{reaction}
  \chem{NO_2} + \chem{O_3} \rightarrow \chem{NO_3} + \chem{O_2},
\end{reaction}
and dry deposition processes. The global abundance of tropospheric ozone is highly variable and it changes, e.g., with time of the day ($\sim$15:00 local time), season (mid-June), altitude, and location \citep{ACP:Schnell2015}. Typical concentrations of surface ozone reach from 10\,\unit{ppb} over the tropical Pacific to 100\,\unit{ppb} in the surrounding areas of high emitting sources \citep[Chapter 8]{IPCC2013}. This variability poses a challenge on both trend analysis from observation as well as validation and intercomparison of models. From the observational side, there is only a limited number of long-term ozone observations, mainly restricted to European sites. From these only three display a statistical significant trend, indicating a doubling of tropospheric ozone since the onset of the industrialization \citep[Chapter 2]{IPCC2013}. But especially the the very low pre-industrial ozone values cannot be reproduced by the likes of most models \citep[Chapter 8]{IPCC2013}.

What is the status and what are the challenges in the dry deposition of ozone - we do not include bromine explosion in the polar regions which are tremendously reducing surface ozone in polar spring \citep{JGR:Oltmans1981,GRL:Bottenheim1986,Nat:Barrie1988,JGR:Bottenheim2006}.

Ozone accumulated over long periods of time inflicts damage on vegetation which leads to loss of primary production in agriculture and forestry.
